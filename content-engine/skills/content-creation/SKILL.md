# Content Creation

Produce content in the creator's voice, at the right length and format for each channel.

## How This Skill Works

1. **Voice layer** — every piece sounds like you (loaded from `CREATOR.md` or `creator-memory/voice.md`)
2. **Format layer** — each channel has specific structure, length, and tone rules

If no voice documentation exists: ask the user to describe their voice, or run `/creator-sprint`.

## Content Types and Formats

### Blog Post
- **Headline**: 50-65 chars, question or statement with clear benefit
- **Opening**: First 100 words must earn the scroll — lead with the insight, not background
- **Structure**: Problem → Framework → Application → Next step
- **Length**: 800-2,000 words depending on topic depth
- **TL;DR**: Include in first 100 words for SEO and skimmers
- **Closing CTA**: One action, clearly stated

### Social Post (LinkedIn)
- **Opening line**: Stops the scroll — bold claim, surprising stat, or direct question
- **Body**: 3-5 short paragraphs, white space between each
- **Length**: Under 1,300 characters
- **CTA**: One question or action at end

### Social Post (X / Twitter)
- **Lead tweet**: Under 280 chars, complete thought or strong hook
- **Thread option**: 3-7 tweets if concept needs more

### Email / Newsletter
- **Subject**: Under 50 chars, specific benefit or curiosity gap
- **Preview text**: 85-100 chars, extends subject, doesn't repeat it
- **Opening**: First sentence hooks; 3-second test
- **CTA**: Single primary action

### Video Script
- **Hook**: First 5 seconds — question, claim, or visual promise
- **Structure**: Hook → Context → Core content → Summary → CTA
- **Pacing**: ~130 words/minute for comfortable delivery

## Channel Tone Adjustment

Voice stays consistent; tone adapts to context:

| Channel | Tone | Example shift |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Blog | Educational, complete | Full arguments, referenced claims |
| LinkedIn | Professional, personal | First-person insight, business framing |
| X/Twitter | Direct, punchy | Shorter sentences, bolder statements |
| Email | Personal, warm | "You" framing, clear next step |
| Video | Conversational, energetic | Action verbs, shorter sentences |

## Repurposing Workflow

1. Start with the most complete format (long-form blog or video)
2. Extract 3-5 key insights as LinkedIn posts
3. Condense core argument to Twitter thread (5-7 tweets)
4. Strip to key takeaways for email summary
5. Generate 3 headline variations for testing

## SEO Checklist (blog posts)
- [ ] Target keyword in title and first 100 words
- [ ] H2 subheadings as natural questions
- [ ] Meta description 150-160 chars with keyword
- [ ] Internal links to 2-3 related pieces
- [ ] FAQ section with 3-5 questions people actually search
- [ ] Alt text on all images

## Quality Check Before Delivering
1. **Voice match** — sounds like the creator?
2. **Opener strength** — would a reader scroll past line 1?
3. **Format fit** — right length and structure for this channel?
4. **Single purpose** — one clear idea or CTA?
5. **Specificity** — are claims supported? Is advice actionable?
