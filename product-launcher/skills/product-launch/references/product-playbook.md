# Product Playbook — Creator Product Development Patterns

Proven patterns for building and shipping digital products as an independent creator.

## The Value Ladder

Every creator's product ecosystem should have products at multiple price points:

```
Free tool/resource     → Attracts audience, collects emails
$7-27 micro-product    → Low-friction first purchase, builds trust
$47-147 core product   → Main offer, solves the primary problem
$297-697 system        → Complete transformation, high-touch
$1k+ done-for-you      → Service wrapper around the products above
```

**Rule:** Each tier funds the marketing for the tier above it. Free → email list → $27 sale → trust → $297 sale.

## Product Type Selection Guide

| You have... | Build... | Time | Price |
|-------------|---------|------|-------|
| A repeatable process | Template or SOP | 1-3 days | $7-47 |
| A workflow you've optimized | Notion/Airtable system | 2-5 days | $27-97 |
| Deep knowledge in an area | Mini-course (3-5 modules) | 1-2 weeks | $47-197 |
| An audience + proven demand | Full course | 3-6 weeks | $97-497 |
| A technical skill + automation | Agent or tool | 1-4 weeks | $97-697 |
| Client work you do repeatedly | Productized service | Ongoing | $500-5k/mo |

## V1 Scoping Rules

### What MUST be in V1
- The single core transformation (one job, done well)
- A way to deliver it (the artifact — template, video, PDF, code)
- A way to sell it (checkout link)
- A way for buyers to contact you (email or Discord)

### What to DEFER (always)
- Community features (V2)
- Advanced customization (V2)
- Integrations with other tools (V2)
- Mobile app (V3+)
- Affiliate program (after 50+ sales)

**Rule:** If you wouldn't be embarrassed, you waited too long to ship.

## Pricing Strategy

### The 10x Value Rule
Price should be 1/10th of the value delivered. If your template saves someone 10 hours at $100/hour, charge $100+.

### Price Anchoring
Always show what problem you're replacing:
- "Instead of hiring a consultant at $500/hr..."
- "Instead of spending 3 weeks figuring this out..."

### Don't Discount Early
First 100 buyers should pay full price. They're your most valuable customers — they buy before proof exists. Reward them with bonuses, not discounts.

### Price Points That Convert
- $7 — impulse purchase, no-brainer
- $27 — considered but easy yes
- $47-97 — needs clear promise, some proof
- $197-297 — needs social proof + clear ROI
- $497+ — needs strong brand + testimonials

## Distribution Patterns

### Email List First
The only distribution channel you own. Every product launch goes to the list first. If you don't have a list, the product launch IS list building.

### Minimum Viable Launch
1. Write one email to your list (or post to social)
2. Include the product link
3. Run for 72 hours
4. Collect 3 testimonials from early buyers
5. Use testimonials to launch again

### Platform Selection by Product Type

| Product type | Platform | Why |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Templates (Notion, Figma) | Gumroad, own site | Simple, low fees |
| Courses | Whop, own site | Community + content |
| Tools/SaaS | Own site | Control, recurring |
| Low-ticket info | Gumroad | Minimal friction |
| High-ticket | Direct + Stripe | Higher margins |

## Product Page Formula

A high-converting product page has:

1. **Headline** — transformation, not feature list
   - ❌ "15 Notion Templates for Productivity"
   - ✅ "Stop losing track of ideas. A Notion system that actually sticks."

2. **Problem paragraph** — 3-5 sentences calling out the exact frustration

3. **Solution intro** — what it is, who built it, why now

4. **What's included** — specific list with quantities (not vague "tons of templates")

5. **Social proof** — 2-3 testimonials above the fold, screenshot format preferred

6. **Who it's for / not for** — specificity builds trust

7. **FAQ** — handle the top 3 objections directly

8. **CTA** — price, button, what happens after purchase

## Launch Sequence (72-Hour Launch)

**Day -3 (Tease)**
- Social post: "Working on something. Solving [specific problem]."
- Email: "Something coming Thursday. Here's the problem it solves."

**Day 0 (Launch)**
- Email 1 (9am): Full launch email with link
- Social: Launch post with visual
- Email 2 (4pm): "Launched today" reminder for non-openers

**Day 1**
- Social: Early testimonial or behind-the-scenes
- Email: Case study or "how to use it" content

**Day 2 (Close)**
- Email: Scarcity or deadline (launch price ends, bonus goes away)
- Social: Final reminder

**Day 3 (Close)**
- Email 3 (morning): Last chance
- Email 4 (2 hours before close): "Closing in 2 hours"

## Post-Launch Optimization

**Within 24 hours of launch:**
- Check where buyers came from (email vs social vs direct)
- Read every reply and question — these reveal objections the page didn't handle
- Note any technical issues (checkout, delivery, access)

**After 10 sales:**
- Collect 3 testimonials (specific outcome, not "great product!")
- Update the product page with testimonials above the fold
- Identify the #1 objection from buyer questions → add FAQ

**After 30 days:**
- Sales volume vs. expectation?
- Average review score?
- Support load — are people confused about anything?
- What's the next logical product for these buyers?

## Recurring Revenue Strategy

One-time products are volatile. Build toward recurring:

1. Start with templates/courses (one-time, builds audience)
2. Create a membership or community around the theme ($27-97/mo)
3. Add a software tool that replaces manual workflows (highest LTV)
4. Wrap the software in a "done with you" service tier

**The creator SaaS ceiling**: Most creators don't need VC-scale SaaS. A tool at $29/month with 200 paying users = $5,800 MRR = $70k ARR. Achievable without a team.
