# Music Production

Engineer precise prompts for AI music generation — consistent style, not random output.

## Pipeline

1. **Define** — purpose, mood, audience
2. **Style load** — pull music config from `creator-memory/music.md`
3. **Prompt engineer** — build the Suno (or compatible) prompt
4. **Document** — log output for style consistency

## Music Purpose Framework

Before engineering a prompt, establish intent:
- What transformation should the music facilitate? (energy, focus, relaxation, inspiration)
- Who is the listener, and what state are they in?
- What state should they be in after?
- Use case: background, content underscore, intro/outro, standalone, atmospheric?

## Suno Prompt Formula

```
[Genre/Style], [Tempo], [Key instruments], [Vocal style], [Mood], [Special elements]
```

| Component | Examples |
|-----------|---------|
| Genre/Style | lo-fi hip hop, cinematic orchestral, dark ambient, future bass, neo-soul |
| Tempo | slow, mid-tempo, uptempo, driving, laid-back, pulsing |
| Key instruments | piano, synth pads, acoustic guitar, 808s, strings, brass, choir |
| Vocal style | no vocals, ethereal female vocals, deep narrator, spoken word |
| Mood | melancholic, triumphant, mysterious, uplifting, meditative, euphoric |
| Special elements | layered textures, build and drop, minimal, lush reverb, distorted |

**Example prompts:**

*Focus/productivity:*
```
Lo-fi hip hop, slow mid-tempo, warm piano melodies over dusty drums, mellow bass,
no vocals, nostalgic and focused mood, vinyl crackle, smooth and unobtrusive
```

*Epic cinematic intro:*
```
Cinematic orchestral, building tempo, full strings and brass, choir in final section,
no main vocals, triumphant and expansive, dramatic crescendo, Hollywood film score style
```

*Brand intro jingle (10-20 sec):*
```
Electronic pop, upbeat, bright synth lead, punchy kick, no vocals,
optimistic and forward-moving, modern and clean, memorable 4-bar hook, intro/logo placement
```

## Style Consistency

To maintain consistent sound across tracks:
1. Document successful prompts in `creator-memory/music.md`
2. Note which elements create the desired sound
3. Use same core descriptors across related tracks, vary only mood/energy
4. Mark "anchor tracks" — reference tracks that define the style

**Style anchor format:**
```markdown
## Style Anchor: [Track Name]
- Core genre: [genre]
- Essential elements: [list]
- Avoid: [list]
- Use for: [context]
- Prompt: [full prompt]
```

## Categories for Creators

| Category | Best for | Elements |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Lo-fi study | Productivity content | Warm piano, dusty drums, vinyl |
| Cinematic orchestral | High-production video intros | Strings, brass, choir, building |
| Dark ambient | Introspective content | Drones, reverb, minimal, mysterious |
| Future bass | Energetic tutorials, hype | Synth leads, wobble bass, punchy drums |
| Neo-soul | Lifestyle, warm brand feel | Soulful vocals, jazz chords, groove |
| Minimal electronic | Clean product videos | Sparse, precise, modern, functional |
| Acoustic indie | Personal content | Guitar, soft percussion, intimate |

## Track Documentation

```markdown
## Track: [Title]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Use case: [context]
- Prompt: [full prompt]
- Score (1-10): [rating]
- Keep: [yes/no]
- Notes: [what worked, what didn't]
```

## Output Format

Deliver:
1. **Prompt** — ready to paste into Suno or compatible tool
2. **Purpose alignment** — confirm it fits the use case
3. **Style notes** — what elements drive the desired sound
4. **Variations** — 2 alternative prompts for different energy levels
